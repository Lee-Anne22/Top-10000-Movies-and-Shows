# Top-10000-Movies-and-Shows
Analysis of the IMBD top 1000 movies and TV shows with a focus on EDA, visualization and statistical insights for this project.

The data will be cleaned and preprocessed before using Python libraries, including Matplotlib and Seaborn, to provide the following visualizations:

1. A distribution of the IMBD_Rating vs Meta_score
2. An analysis of the Top 10 genres
3. A relationship analysis of the Gross vs Number_of_votes
4. A comparison between the IMBD_Rating by ceritificate

Statistical analysis were then applied to find the following insights:

1. The mean, median and standard_deviation for both the Number_of_votes and IMBD_Rating.
2. The correlation between the Gross and the Number_of_Votes
3. Interquartile ranges and outliers

Finally, the following questions were answered:

1. Which director's movies have the highest average Gross?
2. Who were the top 5 directors by Gross?
3. Which actor appears most frequently in the top-rated- ratings higher than 8.5- movies?
4. Do movies with certain actor pairs have a higher Gross?
5. Which genre were most associated with a higher IMBD_Rating?
6. What were the trends between genre vs ratings?
